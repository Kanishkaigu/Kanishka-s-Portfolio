# Student Marks Prediction Project - GitHub Description

## Recommended Description for GitHub:

**Predictive Analytics System for Academic Performance**

Developed a machine learning system to predict student academic performance based on study hours using Linear Regression. The model analyzes the correlation between study time and exam scores, providing data-driven insights for educational planning.

**Key Features:**
- Linear Regression model with Scikit-learn for performance prediction
- Comprehensive data analysis and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- Statistical correlation analysis between study hours and academic outcomes
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering with NumPy

**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Linear Regression

**Impact:** Enables educators and students to make informed decisions about study time allocation based on predictive analytics.
